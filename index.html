          <h2>About Thom Haha</h2>
          <p>
            New Zealand-born musician and audio producer, currently based in Paris.
            Thom Haha makes music that blends close, textural details with wide, layered production.
            Some songs could sound dreamlike while some are upbeat and hype, while some combine the two.
            His work spans solo releases, collaborations, and music for visual projects, with tens of millions
            of streams across platforms.

            He started guitar at seven, added piano soon after, and got into Ableton as a teenager.
            By 14, he was building full tracks on his own. In 2016, he began producing for his friend
            Ngahere Wafer, leading to their first EP <em>You’re So Cool</em> in 2017. The track
            “Sand Outro” gained unexpected attention, kickstarting a partnership that’s still evolving.
          </p>

            Since then, Thom has worked with artists like Annabel Lee, Gardens, and Maxwell Young, while
            continuing to release music under his own name. He studied audio production at SAE in Auckland,
            not to be taught creativity, but to deepen his technical edge. Alongside production, he’s worked
            on soundtracking, field recordings, and mixing for film and media.
