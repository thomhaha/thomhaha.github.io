      <h2>Thom Haha</h2>
      <p>New Zealand-born musician and audio producer, currently based in Paris.
Thom Haha makes music that blends close, textural details with wide, layered production. Some songs could sound dreamlike while some are upbeat and hype, while some combined the two. His work spans solo releases, collaborations, and music for visual projects, with tens of millions of streams across platforms.
He started guitar at seven, added piano soon after, and got into Ableton as a teenager. By 14, he was building full tracks on his own. In 2016, he began producing for his friend Ngahere Wafer, leading to their first EP You’re So Cool in 2017. The track “Sand Outro” gained unexpected attention, kickstarting a partnership that’s still evolving.
Since then, Thom has worked with artists like Annabel Lee, Gardens, and Maxwell Young, while continuing to release music under his own name. He studied audio production at SAE in Auckland, not to be taught creativity, but to deepen his technical edge. Alongside production, he’s worked on soundtracking, field recordings, and mixing for film and media.</p>
